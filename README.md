# My Portfolio
This is a compilation of a small porfolio I've developed during my journey.

## Most recent project (Download Git Repo To Play)
My second, the game I put in the most amount of work into is in this git repo which features a 2D Platformer game to show off how a modern Metroidvania game plays out from start to finish.

## My first game, in pure Python
As I don't have the files anymore I still have a youtube video of the game which everything was built from scratch as well as importing sprites by hand and adjusting them by pixel.
